Description:

"A healthy diet is a solution to many of our health-care problems". Drawing motivations from this, we made an app for mobile/Amazon Alexa, which could help people know their diet consumption in real time and using this feedback improve their eating habits.


What it does:

Record people's audio, extract food keywords through fuzzy matching techniques and give feedback to the user.

steps:

1> Made Alexa record our voices, process it and return us back without AWS (used our laptops as python web server). 
2> Made React Native Client Apps which had features like Audio processing, Speech Synthesis.


Built with:

React Native, Flask, Python WebServer, Alexa Voice
